# Admin Exam 2018

### GNU/Linux

1. What is ‘systemd’? What would be considered an alternative?
    -  systemd is a system and service manager. System-V (SysV) is considered an alternative

2. What does ‘LVM’ stand for, and what does that actually mean?
    - Logical volume management (LVM) is a form of storage virtualization that offers system administrators a more flexible approach to managing disk storage space than traditional partitioning. 

3. A user has somehow renamed a file to a name with strange unicode characters and you cannot delete that file by name. How would you go about deleting that file? Give commands with parameters.

4. You’ve just royally screwed your shell by running cat on a binary. How do you fix this?
    - I usually panic a nd hit Ctrl+C a bunch, then realise I need to type `reset`.

5. You are trying to unmount your ‘/storage’ volume, but ‘umount’ keeps compaining about it being busy. how would you determine who/what is using it. and kill that process? How would you unmount it without killing the process?
    - To find who is using it using `lsof | grep /media/whatever`
    - To kill that process use `kill -9 PID`
    -  umount -l (I think, not very sure on this part)

6. You have a list of hundreds of comressed logfiles in /var/log. Give 3 ways of searching through these logs. Manually extracting and searching them is not an option.
    - zgrep foo compressed_logs.gz
    - zcat compressed-logs.gz | zless
    - bzgrep foo compressed-logs.bz

7. Give 5 distinct advantages of using a package manager rather than building a program from source. What command would you run to fully update a typical Redbrick server?
    - Much easier to install packages than building from source
    - Packages are designed for your distro specifically
    - They can be uninstalled, updated, and upgraded using the package manager
    - Their dependancies will be taken care of by the package manager
    - You don't need to install developer tools on your system (make for example)
    - They are sometimes patched by the package maintainer to fix distro specific bugs
    - sudo apt-get update

8. You want to create a user to be used by a daemon. What do you set its shell to?
    - `sudo adduser --shell /usr/sbin/nologindaemonUser`

9. What is fail2ban? Is it a good idea to run it on your server, why?
    - fail2ban is a piece of software which protects against brute force attacks.
    - Self explanatory right? It bans attackers for X minutes for N attampts and brute forcing the login in Y time.

10. What is a chroot? Why would you use one?
    - A chroot is an operation which changes the apparent root directory for the current running process and its subsequent children.
    - Reasons to use a chroot:
        - you can use it to keep different versions of one program
        - you can use it to simulate an specific environment in order to test some features
        - you can use it to create images of a system different from your main one
