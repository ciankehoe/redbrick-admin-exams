# Admin Exam 2017

### GNU/Linux

1. What is ‘systemd’? What would be considered an alternative?
    -  systemd is a system and service manager. System-V (SysV) is considered an alternative

2. What does ‘LVM’ stand for, and what does that actually mean?
    - Logical volume management (LVM) is a form of storage virtualization that offers system administrators a more flexible approach to managing disk storage space than traditional partitioning. 

3. A user has somehow renamed a file to a name with strange unicode characters and you cannot delete that file by name. How would you go about deleting that file? Give commands with parameters.

4. You’ve just royally screwed your shell by running cat on a binary. How do you fix this?
    - I usually panic a nd hit Ctrl+C a bunch, then realise I need to type `reset`.

5. You are trying to unmount your ‘/storage’ volume, but ‘umount’ keeps compaining about it being busy. how would you determine who/what is using it. and kill that process? How would you unmount it without killing the process?
    - To find who is using it using `lsof | grep /media/whatever`
    - To kill that process use `kill -9 PID`
    -  umount -l (I think, not very sure on this part)

6. You have a list of hundreds of comressed logfiles in /var/log. Give 3 ways of searching through these logs. Manually extracting and searching them is not an option.
    - zgrep foo compressed_logs.gz
    - zcat compressed-logs.gz | zless
    - bzgrep foo compressed-logs.bz

7. Give 5 distinct advantages of using a package manager rather than building a program from source. What command would you run to fully update a typical Redbrick server?
    - Much easier to install packages than building from source
    - Packages are designed for your distro specifically
    - They can be uninstalled, updated, and upgraded using the package manager
    - Their dependancies will be taken care of by the package manager
    - You don't need to install developer tools on your system (make for example)
    - They are sometimes patched by the package maintainer to fix distro specific bugs
    - sudo apt-get update

8. You want to create a user to be used by a daemon. What do you set its shell to?
    - `sudo adduser --shell /usr/sbin/nologindaemonUser`

9. What is fail2ban? Is it a good idea to run it on your server, why?
    - fail2ban is a piece of software which protects against brute force attacks.
    - Self explanatory right? It bans attackers for X minutes for N attampts and brute forcing the login in Y time.

10. What is a chroot? Why would you use one?
    - A chroot is an operation which changes the apparent root directory for the current running process and its subsequent children.
    - Reasons to use a chroot:
        - you can use it to keep different versions of one program
        - you can use it to simulate an specific environment in order to test some features
        - you can use it to create images of a system different from your main one

### FreeBSD

1. Illustrate 3 differences between a GNU/Linux system and a FreeBSD system.
    - 1. Linux is a kernel whereas BSD is an operating system (also includes the kernel). Linux doesn't become an operating system until you combine it with GNU software and some other components.
    - 2. Linux typically manages installed software in binary packages. BSD typically manages a "ports" tree that you use to build software from sources.
    - 3. Different styles of booting - BSD rc.d style booting vs Linux SysV style init.d booting.
2. You’ve been added to the root group on a FreeBSD system. This, however, doesn’t enable you to do anything. Why is this the case?
    - This is because you also need to be added to the wheel group.
    - Use something like `pw groupmod wheel -m $USERNAME` to add a user to the wheel group.
3. What is a Jail? Why might you want to use one?
    - The  BSD jail mechanism is an implementation of OS-level virtualization, allowing sys admins to partition a FreeBSD-based  system into many independent mini-systems, which are called jails. 
    - You might want to use one for security and ease of administration. For example, if you want to define a clear-cut separation between hosted services and those of other users.
4. What does Redbrick use FreeBSD for? 
    - Password safe, and something else that I'm not sure of.
5. What utility would you use to manage users and groups on FreeBSD? 
    - pw can be used to modify all aspects of user accounts
6. How would you have a script ‘resign.sh’ run on startup?
    - Probably use BSD's cron. It understand @reboot as a time directive.
    - So, something like `@reboot /home/user/resign.sh`
7. How would you configure a network interface on FreeBSD?
    - `ifconfig interface ed0` (surely this isn't right)
8. What is the command to list the currently loaded pf rules?
    - `pfctl -s rules`
9. How would you install packages in FreeBSD?
    - Packages can be installed in FreeBSD through the ports system.
10. How would you show the routing table in FreeBSD?
    - `netstat -rn` works, I don't know if you can do it using `route`.
   
### Networking
1. What is an SFP? Where would you expect to find one?
    - A Small Form-factor Pluggable (SFP) is a small transceiver that plugs into the SFP port of a network switch and connects to Fibre Channel and Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) optical fiber cables at the other end. 
2. Why do we only allow packets through our firewall on a select number of ports?
    - The less ports open the better.
    
3. No one can seem to connect to anything on Redbrick. Walk us through how you would go about trouble shooting this.

4. People seem to be able to connect via IP but not via DNS. Name some tools you could use to trouble shoot this.
    - nslookup
    - dig
    - tcptraceroute
    - ip addr show
5. How would you go about looking at a config on one our switches or SRX (juniper or cisco)

6. Give the syntax for adding an entry to DNS(bind9) with the following info graphs.redbrick.dcu.ie point to 136.206.15.69 pretty.redbrick.dcu.ie point to graphs.redbrick.dcu.ie while graphs.redbrick.dcu.ie also points to 2001:41d0:e:1232::1
    - ```

    
      ```
7. Explain briefy what happens when you type in redbrick.dcu.ie into a browser.

8. When would you use tcpdump. Give an example of its syntax.
    - You would use tcpdump when you wanted to view the contents of packets on a network interface
    - `tcpdump host azazel`
9. What is a Vlan? What are they used for?
    - A VLAN (Virtual Local Access Network) is a set of end stations and the switch ports that connect them. A VLAN allows several networks to work virtually as one LAN.
10. What is a virtual interface? What file would you modify to create one?
    - A virtual interface is a virtualized representation of a computer network interface that may or may not correspond directly to a network interface controller.
    - /etc/network/interfaces
