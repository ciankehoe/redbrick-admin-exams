# redbrick-admin-exams

An attempt to collect the answers to all the Redbrick Admin Exams. This make it easier for those in the future. Exams found at https://redbrick.dcu.ie/help/exams

### Contributing

If you see any inconsistencies, wrong answers, missing information, or even some spelling mistakes, don't be an asshole about it - fix it!

In relation to contributing, here's the guidelines:

1. This isn't the place to discuss what should or should not be on the admin exam. We literally just need to collect the answers to past iterations.

2. When it comes to making changes, just feel free to make a PR. It will be reviewed and changes might be requested. Ideally, it's not just myself that conducts PR review, but for now it is.

If there's a significant amount of material contributed, say three or four years worth of exams, I'd be happy to move this repository over to [Redbrick's Github](https://github.com/redbrick). I don't mind if this little project goes unfinished, but I don't intend to let be be unfinished on the Redbrick Github, I hate that we've left a lot of half-hearted stuff there already.
