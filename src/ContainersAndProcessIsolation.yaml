- question: 'What is a container? How does one differ from a VM?'
  answer: >-
    Virtual machines and containers differ in several ways, but the primary
    difference is that containers provide a way to virtualize an OS so that
    multiple workloads can run on a single OS instance. With VMs, the hardware
    is being virtualized to run multiple OS instances. Containers’ speed,
    agility, and portability make them yet another tool to help streamline
    software development.

- question: 'What is LXC? List 2 differences between LXC and Docker.'
  answer: >-
    - LXC is a container technology which gives you lightweight Linux
      containers, which behave like thin VM's.
    - Differences:
      1. In comparison to Linux Containers, Docker is a single application
         virtualization engine which is based on containers.
      2. The Dokcer ecosystem makes use of Dockerfiles, they let you create your
         container automatically according to your instructions, with your
         application pre-configured. There is nothing really comparable in LXC.

      it's PID 1.

      will instead create a new process for bash
