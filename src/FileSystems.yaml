- question: >-
    `ext4`, used by most modern GNU/Linux systems, is a journaling file-system.
    What is meant by this?
  answer: >-
    A journaling file system is a file system that keeps track of changes not
    yet committed to the file system's main part by recording the intentions of
    such changes in a data structure known as a "journal"

- question: 'What does RAID stand for?'
  answer: >-
    RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is a data storage virtualisation
    technology that combines many physical disk drive components into one or
    more logical units for the purposes of data redundancy, performance
    improvement, or both.

- question: >-
    Describe the structure of 3 different RAID variations, giving advantages and
    disadvantages for each. You may describe the structure in words, or with a
    diagram on the provided paper.
  mark: 6
  answer: |-
    1. RAID 5
      - Description: Uses disk striping with parity where data and parity is
        evenly striped across all the disks.
      - Advantages: Fault tolerance and increased performance
        (lower than RAID 0).
      - Disadvantages: Lower performance if performing large amounts of write
        operations because of parity overhead.
    2. RAID 5 (__this isnt raid 5__)
      - Description: Uses disk striping too, but provides increased
        reliability as it stores an extra parity block. That effectively means
        that it is possible for two drives to fail at once without breaking
        the array.
      - Advantages: Even higher redundancy than RAID 5, with increased read
        performance too.
      - Disadvantages: Lower performance if performing large amounts of write
        operations because of parity overhead.
    3. RAID 10
      - Description: Uses disk mirroring and disk striping to protect data. It
        requires a minimum of four disks, and stripes data across mirrored
        pairs.
      - Advantages: Very high performance. Fault tolerance.
      - Disadvantages: Lower usable capacity/High cost. Limited scalability.

- question: 'What is a sticky bit? How and why would you set it on a file?'
  answer: >-
    Permission bit which when set permits only the owner or root user of the
    file or directory to modify, rename or delete the concerned file or
    directory.

- question: >-
    Name a non-RAID multi disk setup. Give an advantage and a disadvantage.
  mark: 2
  answer: |-
    - `JBOD`
    - Description: It is a drive enclosure which is used as an accommodation for
      multiple disk drives. These enclosures can be attached to a raid managing
      system thereby giving a very simple means to expand the capacity of the
      array several times and in a quicker manner.
    - Advantage: There is no wastage of data in the drive. There is no loss in
      the capacity as `JBOD` array lets you to combine the individual disks into
      one single large unit.
    - Disadvantage: `JBOD` does not offer redundancy unlike the RAID technology,
      and lacks fault tolerance.

    What protocol(s) might you use to mount a file-system over a network? What
    one does Redbrick use?

- question: >-
    What are `fdisk` and `gdisk`? What situation would you use each in?
  answer: |-
    - `fdisk` is a command line tool which allows the user to create and
      manipulate disk partition tables, thus creating and manipulating
      partitions on the disk.
    - `gdisk` is an interactive GUID tool which allows users to create and
      manipulate disk partition tables too.

- question: 'What does the command `sync` do? When should it be used?'
  answer: >-
    This forces everything in temporary memory storage to be written to a
    persistent file storage (like a disk) so none of the data is lost.

- question: 'What are the pros and cons of Hardware RAID & Software RAID.'
  answer: >-
    - Hardware RAID:
      - Advantages:
        - Better performance, especially in more complex configurations.
        - Has more RAID configuration options
        - Compatible across different operating systems.
      - Disadvantages:
        - More costly to set up initially.
        - Inconsistent performance for setups that use SSD arrays.
    - Software RAID:
      - Advantages:
        - Low cost of entry.
        - Processors can easily handle RAID 0 & 1 processing with no noticeable
          performance hit.
      - Disadvantages:
        - Often OS specific.
        - Performance hit if you’re using more complex RAID configurations.

- question: 'What is a `UID` and a `GID`? Why are they useful?'
  answer: |-
    - `UID`: User ID
    - `GID`: Group ID
    - `GID` could be of two types, one is a primary group and the other is a
      secondary group.

- question: >-
    What are symlinks? Give two ways in which they differ from hardlinks.
  answer: |-
    - A symbolic link is a term for any file that contains a reference to
      another file or directory in the form of an absolute or relative path.
      This has a different inode number from the original.
    - Hard links are for files only. You cannot link to a file on different
      partition with a different inode number.
    - If the real copy of a symlinkis deleted, the link will not work. If the
      real copy of a hard linkis deleted the link will work, because it accesses
      the underlying data the real copy was accessing.

- question: 'What is the difference between MBR and GPT?'
  answer: |-
    - Master Boot Record is a partition scheme that defines partitions of three
      types - primary, logical and extended.
    - GUID Partition Table is also a parition scheme which defines primary
      partitions only. The reason for this is because it has no boot record.

- question: |-
    Briefly explain the following;
      - RAID 10
      - RAID 5
      - `ZFS`
      - `umask`
      - Sticky Bit
  answer: |-
    - RAID 10
      - uses disk mirroring and disk striping to protect data. It requires a
        minimum of four disks, and stripes data across mirrored pairs.
    - RAID 5
      - uses disk striping with parity where data and parity is evenly striped
        across all the disks
    - `ZFS`
      - does everything `LVM`, RAID, other file systems (`ext4`) - internally
        implements RAID 5, 6 and "7" (which doesn't exist). Magic due to Copy on
        Write and checksumming - so look those up.
    - `umask`
      - `umask` acts as a set of permissions that applications cannot set on
        files. file mode creation mask for processes and cannot be set for
        directories itself.
    - Sticky Bit
      - permission bit which when set permits only the owner or root user of the
        file or directory to modify, rename or delete the concerned file or
        directory.
