- question: >-
    Illustrate 3 differences between a GNU/Linux system and a FreeBSD system.
  answer: |-
    1. Linux is a kernel whereas BSD is an operating system (also includes the
       kernel). Linux doesn't become an operating system until you combine it
       with GNU software and some other components.
    2. Linux typically manages installed software in binary packages. BSD
       typically manages a "ports" tree that you use to build software from
       sources.
    3. Different styles of booting - BSD `rc.d` style booting vs Linux `SysV`
       style `init.d` booting.

- question: >-
    You’ve been added to the root group on a FreeBSD system. This, however,
    doesn’t enable you to do anything. Why is this the case?
  answer: |-
    - This is because you also need to be added to the wheel group.
    - Use something like `pw groupmod wheel -m $USERNAME` to add a user to the
      wheel group.

- question: What is a Jail? Why might you want to use one?
  answer: |-
    - The BSD jail mechanism is an implementation of OS-level Process isolation,
      allowing sys admins to partition a FreeBSD-based system into many
      independent mini-systems, which are called jails.
    - You might want to use one for security and ease of administration. For
      example, if you want to define a clear-cut separation between hosted
      services and those of other users.

- question: "What does `ports` mean in the context of a FreeBSD system?"
  answer: >-
    This usually refers to FreeBSD's ports and packages collection. This is a
    way for administrators to install applications. It's really cool from what
    I hear, I think it uses keys to verify the integrity of downloaded files?
