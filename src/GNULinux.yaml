    You are trying to unmount your `/storage` volume, but `umount` keeps
    complaining about it being busy. how would you determine who/what is using
    it. and kill that process? How would you unmount it without killing the
    process?
  answer: |-
    - To find who is using it using `lsof | grep /media/whatever`
    - To kill that process use `kill -9 PID`
    - `umount -l` (I think, not very sure on this part)

- question: 'What is a `chroot`? Why would you use one?'
  answer: |-
    - A `chroot` is an operation which changes the apparent root directory for
      the current running process and its subsequent children.
    - Reasons to use a `chroot`:
      - you can use it to keep different versions of one program
      - you can use it to simulate an specific environment in order to test
        some features
      - you can use it to create images of a system different from your main one

- question: >-
    Give 5 distinct advantages of using a package manager rather than building a
    program from source. What command would you run to fully update a typical
    Redbrick server?
  answer: |-
    - Much easier to install packages than building from source
    - Packages are designed for your distro specifically
    - They can be uninstalled, updated, and upgraded using the package manager
    - Their dependencies will be taken care of by the package manager
    - You don't need to install developer tools on your system
      (make for example)
    - They are sometimes patched by the package maintainer to fix distro
      specific bugs
    - `sudo apt-get update`
