- question: >-
    You have 5 2TB drives in a RAID 6 array. Give a short explanation of what
    this means, and calculate how much storage you will have available for use
    in this situation.
  answer: |-
    - 5 2TB drive in RAID 6
      ```
      - - - p q
      - - p q -
      - p q - -
      p q - - -
      ```
    - This means your have dual parity. You have (essentially) 2 dual parity
      disks distributed across many disks (in this case 5). This means 2 disks
      can fail in your setup and you can still replace them using the parities
      efficiently.
    - Out of a possible 20TB, 18TB is available for storage.

      getting someone in to fix the A/C. Preferably whoever installed it.
    - Notify members via email what has happened and what services are
      unavailable at this current time.
    - Monitor Devices temperatures.

- question: Explain RAID 0, 1 and 5
  answer: |-
    - RAID0: improved performance but no redundancy. more disks=higher risk of
      failure.
    - RAID1: data written identically to two drives, array can tolerate 1 drive
      dying.
    - RAID5: Needs all drives but 1 to work to operate, can tolerate 1 drive
      dying.
