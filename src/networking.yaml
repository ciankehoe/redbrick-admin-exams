- question: >-
    You should always change the serial number when modifying DNS entries. What
    does this mean, and why should you do it? What would happen if you didnâ€™t?
  answer: |-
    - This means you should must make a change to the serial number before each
      incremental change to your DNS entry.
    - You should do this as this is how workers keep track if they need to
      update their cached copy of the zone.
    - If you don't update the serial number, the worker will continue to read
      the cached copy of the zone.
