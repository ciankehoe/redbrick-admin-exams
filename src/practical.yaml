    1. Create a user `ted` with a home directory of `/home/ted`
    2. Make ted a member of `harry` group and give that group write access to
       directory `/home/ted/shared`
    3. Force the directory contents to be owned by the `harry` group.
    4. The VM you are using has a free unformated partition. Format this partion
       to be swap and make the VM mount the swap patition at startup.
    5. Create a cron job that will synchronise the contents of /etc/ every night
       to a remote server over ssh. (remote server details are provided on your
