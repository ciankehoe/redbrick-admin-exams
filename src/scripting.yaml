    You've realised that we run a 10 year old version of php and update it. All
    the old php scripts break. Turns out users with old mysql password, with a
    hash of length 16 bit, need to reset their password. Write a script to find
    all users who need to change their with the old passwords, email them saying
    they need to change their password and that their php has been disabled. The
    script should also disable those users php if it access mysql.
